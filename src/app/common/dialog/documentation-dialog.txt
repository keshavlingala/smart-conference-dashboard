DIALOG COMPONENT

Parent Component:

    Task: Sends a template.
    To send a template the parent component calls the method present in dialog-factory service. It passes two objects
    dialogData that contains template and options that contains height(number in pixels), width(number in pixels) and disableClose(boolean)



Dialog Factory Service:

    Has a method open() which takes in two parameters dialogData and options.
    DialogData is an object that contains a template sent my the parent component. And options contain details of dialog's width,height and disableClose button(close button
    on the dialog box should be displayed or not) feature.

      Method:
      open(dialogData: DialogData<T>,
          options: DialogOptions): void {
        const dialogRef = this.dialog.open<DialogComponent<T>, DialogData<T>>(
          DialogComponent,
          {
            ...this.fetchOptions(options),
            data: dialogData
          }
        );
        dialogRef.afterClosed().pipe(first());
      }

    In the open method the template is then passed to the Dialog Component using the inbuilt method dialog.open(<component name> , data)
    where dialog is of type MatDialog. Using dialogRef the dialog can be closed.

        private fetchOptions({
                            width,
                            height,
                            disableClose
                          }: DialogOptions): any {
        return {
          width: `${width}px`,
          height: `${height}px`,
          disableClose
        };
      }

    The fetchOptions method is called inside dialog.open() to set the width, height and disableClose parameters.
    With all these details a dialog component can be set and opened and closed whenever required.


Dialog Component:

    Recieves data from the service with the help of MAT_DIALOG_DATA.

    constructor( public dialogRef: MatDialogRef<DialogComponent<T>>, @Inject(MAT_DIALOG_DATA)
        public data: {
          template: TemplateRef<any>
        }
      )
      {  }

    The data object contains the template

    This template is used in html in the below tag:
    <ng-container [ngTemplateOutlet]="data.template"></ng-container>



In this way reusablity of this component is achieved and any componend can send a template to the Dialog Component to display it as a popup.
